# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

A self-evolving coding agent CLI built on [yoagent](https://github.com/yologdev/yoagent). The agent spans multiple Rust source files under `src/`. A GitHub Actions cron job (`scripts/evolve.sh`) runs the agent hourly using a 3-phase pipeline (plan → implement → respond), which reads its own source, picks improvements, implements them, and commits — if tests pass. All runs use a flat 8h gap (~3/day). Sponsors get benefit tiers (issue priority, shoutout issues, listing eligibility) but no run-frequency speedup. One-time sponsors ($2+) get 1 accelerated run that bypasses the gap (only consumed when they have open issues; tracked in `sponsors/credits.json`).

**Sponsor benefit tiers:**

Monthly recurring (benefits only):
- $5/mo: Issue priority (💖)
- $10/mo: Priority + shoutout issue
- $25/mo: Above + SPONSORS.md eligible
- $50/mo: Above + README eligible

One-time (cumulative — each tier includes all benefits below it):
- $2: 1 accelerated run (bypasses 8h gap)
- $5: Accelerated run + issue priority (14 days)
- $10: Above + shoutout issue (30 days)
- $20: Above + SPONSORS.md eligible (30 days)
- $50: Above + priority for 60 days + SPONSORS.md + README eligible
- $1,200 💎 Genesis: All above + permanent priority + SPONSORS.md + README + journal acknowledgment (never expires)

## Build & Test Commands

```bash
cargo build              # Build
cargo test               # Run tests
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings   # Lint (CI treats warnings as errors)
cargo fmt -- --check     # Format check
cargo fmt                # Auto-format
```

CI runs all four checks (build, test, clippy with -D warnings, fmt check) on PR to main. A separate Pages workflow builds and deploys the website on push to main.

To run the agent interactively:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... cargo run
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... cargo run -- --model claude-opus-4-6 --skills ./skills
```

To trigger a full evolution cycle:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... ./scripts/evolve.sh
```

## Architecture

**Multi-file agent** (`src/`):
- `main.rs` — agent core, REPL, streaming event handling, rendering with ANSI colors, sub-agent tool integration, AskUserTool (interactive question-asking)
- `hooks.rs` — Hook trait, HookRegistry, AuditHook, HookedTool wrapper, maybe_hook helper
- `cli.rs` — CLI argument parsing, subcommands, configuration
- `format/mod.rs` — Color, constants, utility functions, test output filtering, re-exports
- `format/highlight.rs` — syntax highlighting for code, JSON, YAML, TOML
- `format/cost.rs` — pricing, cost display, token formatting
- `format/markdown.rs` — MarkdownRenderer for streaming markdown output
- `format/tools.rs` — Spinner, ToolProgressTimer, ActiveToolState, ThinkBlockFilter
- `prompt.rs` — prompt construction for evolution sessions

Uses `yoagent::Agent` with `AnthropicProvider`, `default_tools()`, and an optional `SkillSet`.

**Documentation** (`docs/`): mdbook source in `docs/src/`, config in `docs/book.toml`. Output goes to `site/book/` (gitignored). The journal homepage (`site/index.html`) is built by `scripts/build_site.py`. Both are built and deployed by the Pages workflow (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`), not during evolution.

**Evolution loop** (`scripts/evolve.sh`): pipeline:
1. Verifies build → fetches GitHub issues (community, self, help-wanted) via `gh` CLI + `scripts/format_issues.py` → scans for pending replies on previously touched issues
2. **Phase A** (Planning): Agent reads everything, writes task files to `session_plan/`
3. **Phase B** (Implementation): Agents execute each task (20 min each), with two fix loops: build/test failures get up to 10 fix attempts (10 min each), then the evaluator runs and rejections get up to 9 more fix attempts (10 min each). Reverts only after all fix attempts are exhausted. Max 3 tasks per session.
4. Verifies build, fixes or reverts → agent-driven issue responses (agent directly calls `gh issue comment`/`close`) → pushes

**Skills** (`skills/`): Markdown files with YAML frontmatter loaded via `--skills ./skills`. Four core skills (immutable) define the agent's evolution workflow:
- `self-assess` — read own code, try tasks, find bugs/gaps
- `evolve` — safely modify source, test, revert on failure
- `communicate` — write journal entries and issue responses
- `research` — internet lookups and knowledge caching

Additional skills:
- `social` — community interaction via GitHub Discussions
- `family` — fork registration, introduction, and cross-fork discussion via the yoyobook discussion category
- `release` — binary release pipeline

**Discussion categories**: General, Journal Club, The Show, Ideas, and `yoyobook` (family discussions for yoyo forks — registration address book, introductions, cross-fork conversation). The `yoyobook` category is created manually in repo settings; `format_discussions.py` fetches all categories automatically.

**Memory system** (`memory/`): Two-layer architecture — append-only JSONL archives (source of truth, never compressed) and active context markdown (regenerated daily by `.github/workflows/synthesize.yml` with time-weighted compression tiers):
- `memory/learnings.jsonl` — self-reflection archive. Each line: `{"type":"lesson","day":N,"ts":"ISO8601","source":"...","title":"...","context":"...","takeaway":"..."}`
- `memory/social_learnings.jsonl` — social insight archive. Each line: `{"type":"social","day":N,"ts":"ISO8601","source":"...","who":"@user","insight":"..."}`
- `memory/active_learnings.md` — synthesized prompt context (recent=full, medium=condensed, old=themed groups)
- `memory/active_social_learnings.md` — synthesized social prompt context
- Archives are appended via `python3` with `json.dumps()` (never `echo` — prevents quote-breaking). Admission gate: only write if genuinely novel AND would change future behavior.
- Context loaded centrally by `scripts/yoyo_context.sh` → `$YOYO_CONTEXT` (WHO YOU ARE, YOUR VOICE, SELF-WISDOM, SOCIAL WISDOM, YOUR ECONOMICS, YOUR SPONSORS sections)

**Release pipeline** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): Triggered by `v*` tags. Builds binaries for 4 targets (Linux x86_64, macOS Intel, macOS ARM, Windows x86_64) and publishes a GitHub Release with tarballs/zips + SHA256 checksums. Install scripts:
- `install.sh` — `curl -fsSL ... | bash` for macOS/Linux
- `install.ps1` — `irm ... | iex` for Windows PowerShell

**State files** (read/written by the agent during evolution):
- `IDENTITY.md` — the agent's constitution and rules (DO NOT MODIFY)
- `PERSONALITY.md` — voice and values (DO NOT MODIFY)
- `JOURNAL.md` — chronological log of evolution sessions (append at top, never delete)
- `DAY_COUNT` — integer tracking current evolution day
- `session_plan/` — ephemeral directory with per-task files (task_01.md, task_02.md, etc.), written by Phase A planning agent (gitignored)
- `ISSUES_TODAY.md` — ephemeral, generated during evolution from GitHub issues (gitignored)
- `ECONOMICS.md` — what money and sponsorship mean to yoyo (DO NOT MODIFY)
- `SPONSORS.md` — auto-maintained sponsor recognition (only additions, never removals; amounts shown so yoyo understands the investment)
- `sponsors/credits.json` — one-time sponsor credit tracking (total_cents, run_used, benefit_expires, etc.)
- `sponsors/shoutouts.json` — tracks which recurring sponsors have received shoutout issues (dedup)


## yoagent: Don't Reinvent the Wheel

yoyo is built on [yoagent](https://github.com/yologdev/yoagent). Before implementing any agent-related or low-level agent feature, **check if yoagent already provides it**. Past examples of reinvented wheels:
- Manual context compaction (`compact_agent`, `auto_compact_if_needed`) — yoagent has `ContextConfig`, `CompactionStrategy`, and built-in 3-level compaction
- Hardcoded token limits — yoagent has `ExecutionLimits` (max_turns, max_total_tokens, max_duration)
- Ignoring `MessageStart`/`MessageEnd` events — yoagent streams these for agent stop messages

**Before building agent infrastructure in src/:**
1. Search yoagent's source (`~/.cargo/registry/src/*/yoagent-*/src/`) for existing features
2. Check yoagent's `Agent` builder methods, tool traits, callbacks (`on_before_turn`, `on_after_turn`, `on_error`), and examples
3. If yoagent has it → use it. If yoagent almost has it → file an issue on yoagent. If yoagent doesn't have it → build it in yoyo.

Key yoagent features available: `SubAgentTool`, `ContextConfig`, `ExecutionLimits`, `CompactionStrategy`, `AgentEvent` stream, `default_tools()`, `SkillSet`, `with_sub_agent()`.

## Safety Rules

These are enforced by the `evolve` skill and `evolve.sh`:
- Never modify `IDENTITY.md`, `PERSONALITY.md`, `ECONOMICS.md`, `scripts/evolve.sh`, `scripts/format_issues.py`, `scripts/build_site.py`, or `.github/workflows/`
- Every code change must pass `cargo build && cargo test`
- If build fails after changes, revert with `git checkout -- src/ Cargo.toml Cargo.lock`
- Never delete existing tests
- Multiple tasks per evolution session, each verified independently
- Write tests before adding features
- **Never use byte indexing on strings.** `s[..n]`, `s.truncate(n)`, and `s.split_at(n)` panic if `n` falls inside a multi-byte UTF-8 character. Use `is_char_boundary()` to find a safe boundary first:
  ```rust
  // BAD: panics on multi-byte chars like ✓ (3 bytes)
  acc.truncate(max_bytes);
  // GOOD: find nearest char boundary
  let mut b = max_bytes;
  while b > 0 && !acc.is_char_boundary(b) { b -= 1; }
  acc.truncate(b);
  ```
  This caused planning agent crashes in production (#250).
